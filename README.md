Here is the repository for the scripts used in developing manuscript "Genetic insights into the age-specific biological mechanisms governing human ovarian ageing".

Currently we list three folders:

**runCoxModels** gives the main code to run the analysis and sensitivity analysis

**figures** gives the scripts to draw main and supplementary figures and process the corresponding data

**tables** gives the scripts to draw main and supplementary tables and process the corresponding data
